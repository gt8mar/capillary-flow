# Capillary Flow Analysis Pipeline Diagrams

This folder contains flowchart diagrams that visualize the capillary flow analysis pipeline. The diagrams illustrate the workflow, data flow, and processing steps used in our capillary analysis system.

## Available Diagrams

1. **Basic Pipeline Flowchart** (`capillary_flow_pipeline.md`)
   - A simple overview showing the main scripts and their relationships
   - Color-coded by processing stage (preprocessing, identification, analysis)

2. **Detailed Process and Data Flowchart** (`capillary_flow_detailed.md`)
   - Separates processing scripts from their data outputs
   - Shows both the scripts and the data artifacts they produce

3. **File Type and Stage Flowchart** (`capillary_flow_file_types.md`)
   - Organized into stage-based subgraphs
   - Shows file types (.tiff, .png, .csv, etc.) throughout the pipeline
