# Capillary Flow Documentation

This folder contains documentation for the capillary flow analysis project, which accompanies our paper on blood flow analysis in capillaries.

## Contents

- **figure_generation.md**: Detailed explanation of how all figures in the paper were generated
- **pipeline_explanation.md**: Documentation of the full data processing pipeline for capillary flow analysis
- **paper_preprints/**: Contains preprint versions of our paper
  - `2025.02.24.25322798v1.full-methods.pdf`: The latest preprint with complete methods section

## About the Project

This documentation explains the methods used in our paper on capillary blood flow analysis. The project involves:

1. Image acquisition of capillary blood flow
2. Image processing to enhance and segment capillaries
3. Capillary identification and consistent naming
4. Centerline detection and kymograph generation
5. Velocity extraction and validation
6. Statistical analysis of blood flow under different conditions

The documentation is divided into:
- Explanations of the figure generation process for all manuscript figures
- Detailed explanations of each step in the data processing pipeline

For actual code implementation, please refer to the `src/` directory in the main repository.
