Segment Frog

This script performs segmentation on an image of a frog using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). 
It allows for segmentation based on user input (point, box, or two points) and analyzes the segmented 
frog to determine the redness of different areas. The script also includes quality control checks 
for lighting and contrast.

Steps:
1. Load the Segment Anything Model (SAM).
2. Load an image.
3. Add SAM to the code.
4. Run SAM.
5. Input either a point, a box, or two points to segment the frog.
6. Outputs:
    - Masks: A collection of points representing the segmented areas.
    - Scores: Confidence scores for the segmentation.
    - Logits: Raw prediction values (check what this is).
7. Analyze the segmented frog:
    - Determine how red the frog is.
    - Separate RGB channels and name them.
    - Compare green and red channels.
    - Identify areas that are more red than others.
    - Segment more parts of the frog and check those.
    - Analyze if the inside is more red than the outside (using radial circles).
    - Skeletonize the frog image.
8. Quality control:
    - Assess the evenness of the light (background and on the frog).
    - Generate row light profile and average across rows.
    - Generate column light profile and average across columns.
    - Normalize contrast.
    - Compare background colors and contrast.

Things to remember:
- Separate RGB channels and name them.
